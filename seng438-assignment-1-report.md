# Introduction
 
This lab was used to teach students about exploratory, manual functional testing and regression testing. It also got students familiar with Backlog, a website used to create a list of issues with a program. Before the lab, we knew that exploratory testing was playing around with a program and see if we could find any bugs with key features. Manual functional testing was testing specific functions using a plan that would specify inputs and expected outputs.


# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

From section 1.3.1 in the exploratory test plan, we split into 2 pairs consisting of Michele and Dylan as pair 1 and Faisal and Cheyenne as pair 2. Both pairs went on to use the modules described in section 1.1.1 in the exploratory test plan. For over 30 minutes, both pairs played around with the features of the programs and checked if the modules worked as instended. If any bugs were found, issues were logged in the Backlog defect tracking system.
