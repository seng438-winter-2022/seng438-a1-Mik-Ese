# Introduction
 
This lab was used to teach students about exploratory, manual functional testing and regression testing. It also got students familiar with Backlog, a website used to create a list of issues with a program. Before the lab, we knew that exploratory testing was playing around with a program and see if we could find any bugs with key features. Manual functional testing was testing specific functions using a plan that would specify inputs and expected outputs.


# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

From section 1.3.1 in the exploratory test plan, we split into 2 pairs consisting of Michele and Dylan as pair 1 and Faisal and Cheyenne as pair 2. Both pairs went on to use the modules described in section 1.1.1 in the exploratory test plan. For over 30 minutes, both pairs played around with the features of the programs and checked if the modules worked as instended. If any bugs were found, issues were logged in the Backlog defect tracking system.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

With exploratory testing, the user is less restricted with the types of tests the program can undergo. For example, the bug in version 1.0 where selecting an invalid menu option would withdraw money was only found in exploratory testing. In contrast, manual functional testing is more structural with a broader scope on the types of test cases. Manual functional testing is also more rigerous because it uses a set plan of tests with specified input, initial state and output. As seen in Appendix C of the lab outline, the SUT shows exactly how each use case has a specific outcome being tested.

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

We had two layers of peer testing. The first layer was through the techinque of pair testing, where the partner analyzes the test cases being executed by the tester. The second layer was through the cross review of the each pair reviewing the other. For example, when one pair found a defect and they report the bug into Backlog, they can check if the bug was already reported on Backlog. If the bug was already documented, they can check and review the bug. If not, then they can issue a new bug report.

Additionally, every member reevaluated every filed bug report to ensure that there were no errors in reporting. 


# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

Pair 1 Testing done by Dylan and Michele. 

Pair 2 Testing done by Faisal and Cheyanne.

Both pairs did test cases outlined in the test plan for Exploratory testing. 

For Regression testing, the pairs switched roles and reviewed the bug reports listed on Backlog and checked if the bugs were still present in the updated version (1.1) of the ATM system.


# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

### Difficulties encountered
- Preparation work for the Exploratory test plan took much longer than expected.


### Challenges overcome
- Organizing bugs into categories
- Avoiding duplicate bug reports


### Lessons learned
- How to use Backlog as a Bug tracking tool
- Proper ways on how to report a bug

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself
Informative lab about testing.
